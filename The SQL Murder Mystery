# Solution to SQL Murdery Mystery

## Prompt

> A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the crime was a ​murder​ that occurred sometime on ​Jan.15, 2018​ and that it took place in ​SQL City​. Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police department’s database.

## Witness reports

```SQL
SELECT description FROM crime_scene_report
WHERE date = '20180115' AND type = 'murder' AND city = 'SQL City'
```

> Security footage shows that there were 2 witnesses. The first witness lives at the last house on "Northwestern Dr". The second witness, named Annabel, lives somewhere on "Franklin Ave".

```SQL
WITH witness1 AS (
    SELECT id FROM person
    WHERE address_street_name = 'Northwestern Dr'
    ORDER BY address_number DESC LIMIT 1
), witness2 AS (
    SELECT id FROM person
    WHERE INSTR(name, 'Annabel') > 0 AND address_street_name = 'Franklin Ave'
), witnesses AS (
    SELECT *, 1 AS witness FROM witness1
    UNION
    SELECT *, 2 AS witness FROM witness2
)
SELECT witness, transcript FROM witnesses
LEFT JOIN interview ON witnesses.id = interview.person_id
```

### Witness 1

> I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out. He had a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag. The membership number on the bag started with "48Z". Only gold members have those bags. The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W".

### Witness 2

> I saw the murder happen, and I recognized the killer from my gym when I was working out last week on January the 9th.

## Suspects

Cross-referencing the gym memberships, gym check-ins, and drivers license:

```SQL
WITH gym_checkins AS (
    SELECT person_id, name
    FROM get_fit_now_member
    LEFT JOIN get_fit_now_check_in ON get_fit_now_member.id = get_fit_now_check_in.membership_id
    WHERE membership_status = 'gold' -- Only gold members have those bags
      AND id REGEXP '^48Z' -- membership number on the bag started with "48Z"
      AND check_in_date = '20180109' -- Witness 2 recognized him on January the 9th
), suspects AS (
    SELECT gym_checkins.person_id, gym_checkins.name, plate_number, gender
    FROM gym_checkins
    LEFT JOIN person ON gym_checkins.person_id = person.id
    LEFT JOIN drivers_license ON person.license_id = drivers_license.id
)
SELECT * FROM suspects
-- The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W"
WHERE INSTR(plate_number, 'H42W') > 0 AND gender = 'male'
```

| person_id|name          |plate_number |gender |
|---------:|:-------------|:------------|:------|
|     67318|Jeremy Bowers |0H42W2       |male   |

```SQL
INSERT INTO solution VALUES (1, "Jeremy Bowers");

SELECT value FROM solution;
```
